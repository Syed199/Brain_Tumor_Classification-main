Used an efficient net model and trained it on a Brain MRI dataset. This dataset has more than 3000 Brain MRI scans which are categorized into four classes - Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. The objective of this project was to create an image classification model that can predict Brain MRI scans that belong to one of the four classes with reasonably high accuracy.
